Here are some tips to help you achieve that:</p><h3>1. Keep your hair trimmed regularly</h3><p>Even though you're growing out your hair, it's essential to keep it trimmed to avoid split ends and maintain a healthy look. A trim every six to eight weeks can help keep your hair looking neat and prevent it from looking too shaggy.</p><h3>2. Experiment with different haircuts</h3><p>Just because you're growing out your hair doesn't mean you can't experiment with different haircuts. Consult with your hairstylist to find a style that works for you and complements your face shape. You can try adding layers or bangs to frame your face and add dimension to your hair.</p><h3>3. Use hair accessories</h3><p>As your hair grows, you may find it challenging to style it the way you want. Hair accessories like headbands, hair clips, and scrunchies can help keep your hair in place and add some flair to your hairstyles. Experiment with different styles and see what works best for you.</p><h3>4. Embrace the natural texture of your hair</h3><p>Short hair can have a lot of texture, and as it grows out, that texture can become more pronounced. Embrace the natural texture of your hair and work with it instead of trying to fight it. You can use texturizing products like sea salt spray to enhance your hair's natural texture and create a beachy, effortless look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to help you make short hair look good while growing it out:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine your face shape</h3><p>Knowing your face shape is essential when it comes to choosing the right haircut.

Experiment with different hairstyles to find one that works for you and complements your face shape.
