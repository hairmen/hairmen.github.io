If it's caused by a medical condition, you may need to treat the underlying condition first.</p><h3>2. Manage stress</h3><p>Stress can be a major contributing factor to hair loss. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, try to find ways to manage your stress levels. This could include meditation, yoga, or regular exercise.</p><h3>3.

These nutrients are essential for healthy hair growth.</p><h3>4.

Consider medication or hair transplantation</h3><p>If your hair loss is severe, you may need to consider medication or hair transplantation. These treatments can help to promote hair growth and restore your hairline.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for managing hair loss:</p><h3>1. Be patient</h3><p>Managing hair loss takes time and patience. Don't expect overnight results. It may take several months for you to see the full effects of your treatment.</p><h3>2.
