Use your fingertips to gently massage the bald spot for several minutes each day. <h3>2. Use Essential Oils</h3> Essential oils like peppermint, lavender, and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Mix a few drops of your chosen oil with a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba oil and apply it to the bald spot. Leave it on for at least 30 minutes before washing it off. <h3>3. Take Supplements</h3> Supplements like biotin, vitamin D, and iron can help improve hair growth. Talk to your doctor before taking any new supplements. <h3>4. Use Minoxidil</h3> Minoxidil is a medication that can help stimulate hair growth.
