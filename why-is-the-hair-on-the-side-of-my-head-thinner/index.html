Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein to provide your hair with the nutrients it needs to grow strong and healthy.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>If you are concerned about thinning hair on the sides of your head, here are some steps you can take to address the issue:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine the Cause</h3><p>The first step in addressing thinning hair is to determine the cause.

Consult with your doctor before taking any supplements to ensure they are safe for you to use.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and contribute to thinning.
