This haircut can be a bit intimidating to try on your own, but with the right tools and techniques, it's definitely doable. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of cutting a pixie cut with shaved sides, from sectioning your hair to adding the finishing touches.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A pixie cut with shaved sides is a short, cropped hairstyle that features closely shaved sides and longer hair on top. This style is often associated with a punk or edgy look, but it can also be styled in a more sophisticated way. The shaved sides can be cut to different lengths, depending on your preference, and the hair on top can be styled in a variety of ways, from slicked back to tousled and messy.</p><h2>How to Cut a Pixie Cut with Shaved Sides</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have all the necessary tools on hand. You'll need a set of clippers with a variety of guards, a comb, a pair of scissors, and some hair clips to section your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Start by sectioning your hair into three parts: the top, the left side, and the right side. Use hair clips to keep each section separate.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Sides</h3><p>Using your clippers and a guard, start cutting the sides of your hair. Begin with the longest guard and work your way down to a shorter guard until you achieve your desired length. Be sure to trim the hair around your ears and the nape of your neck as well.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Sides and Top</h3><p>Once you've cut the sides to your liking, it's time to blend them with the hair on top. Use a pair of scissors to trim the hair on top, taking care to blend it seamlessly with the shaved sides.</p><h3>Step 5: Finishing Touches</h3><p>After you've finished cutting your hair, take a few minutes to add some finishing touches. Use your clippers to clean up any stray hairs around your hairline and ears, and use scissors to trim any longer sections. Style your hair as desired, using products like gel or wax to create volume and texture.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you cut your pixie cut with shaved sides:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down, to avoid cutting your hair too short</li><li>Take your time and be patient – this is a precise haircut that requires attention to detail</li><li>Use a mirror to check your progress from different angles</li><li>Consider getting a friend or family member to help you, especially if this is your first time cutting your own hair</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting a pixie cut with shaved sides:</p><h3>1. Can I cut a pixie cut with shaved sides on my own?</h3><p>Yes, with the right tools and techniques, you can cut a pixie cut with shaved sides on your own. However, it can be helpful to have a friend or family member to assist you.</p><h3>2. What length should I cut the shaved sides?</h3><p>The length of the shaved sides will depend on your personal preference. Some people prefer a very short buzz cut, while others prefer a longer, more subtle shave.</p><h3>3. Can I style my pixie cut with shaved sides in different ways?</h3><p>Yes, a pixie cut with shaved sides can be styled in a variety of ways. You can use products like gel or wax to create volume and texture, or slick your hair back for a more sophisticated look.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>If you're cutting your own hair, it's important to take good care of it afterwards. Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and shiny, and consider using a leave-in conditioner or hair mask to give it an extra boost.</p><p>Cutting a pixie cut with shaved sides can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it does require some skill and patience. With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a bold and edgy look that's sure to turn heads.</p></article>
