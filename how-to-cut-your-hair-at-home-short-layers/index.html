A: It's best to cut your hair when it's dry, as wet hair can shrink when it dries. Q: How often should I cut my short layers? A: It depends on how fast your hair grows. On average, you should cut your hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain your short layers. Q: Can I cut my hair without clips? A: Clips help to keep your hair in place while you cut it, but you can use your fingers instead if you don't have clips. <h2>Hair Care</h2> After cutting your hair, it's important to take care of it to maintain its shape and health. Here are some tips for hair care: - Use a shampoo and conditioner that's suitable for your hair type. - Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can damage your hair. - Use a hair mask once a week to nourish your hair. - Get regular trims to prevent split ends. - Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protection spray. In conclusion, cutting your hair at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. With the right tools, techniques, and hair care, you can achieve a professional-looking haircut without leaving your house. So why not give it a try? Who knows, you might just discover a new talent! </article>
