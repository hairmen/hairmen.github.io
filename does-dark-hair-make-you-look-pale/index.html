However, there is a common misconception that dark hair can make you look pale. This is mainly because dark hair creates a contrast against the skin, which can make the skin appear lighter.</p><p>While this may be true to some extent, there are ways to counteract this effect and make sure you look your best with dark hair.</p><h2>How to Look Your Best with Dark Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips on how to look your best with dark hair:</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Shade</h3><p>The key to looking your best with dark hair is to choose the right shade.

If you have a darker complexion, opt for a lighter shade of brown or auburn.</p><h3>2. Use Makeup to Your Advantage</h3><p>Makeup can be your best friend when it comes to looking your best with dark hair. Use makeup to enhance your features and add color to your face. Use a bronzer to add warmth to your complexion and a blush to add a pop of color to your cheeks.</p><h3>3. Highlight Your Hair</h3><p>Another way to add dimension to your dark hair is to highlight it. Highlights can add depth and texture to your hair, making it look more vibrant and alive.
