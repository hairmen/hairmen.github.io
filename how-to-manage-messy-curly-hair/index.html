When you do shampoo, be gentle and avoid scrubbing your scalp too vigorously.

Hold the diffuser close to your scalp and move it in a circular motion to help define your curls. TIP 3: Sleep on a Silk Pillowcase Cotton pillowcases can cause friction that can lead to frizz and tangles. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase can help keep your curls smooth and defined. FAQ Here are some frequently asked questions about managing messy curly hair: Q: How can I prevent frizz? A: To prevent frizz, avoid touching your hair too much and use a leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum. Q: How can I define my curls? A: Use a curl-defining product, such as a curl cream or gel, and scrunch your hair as it dries. Q: How can I refresh my curls on days when I don&#39;t wash my hair? A: Spray your hair with a mixture of water and leave-in conditioner, then scrunch your curls to revive them.
