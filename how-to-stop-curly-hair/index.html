How to Stop Curly Hair If you want to stop curly hair, you have a few options. The most effective method is to use a chemical relaxer, which will permanently straighten your hair.

FAQ Q: Is it safe to use a chemical relaxer on my hair? A: Chemical relaxers can be damaging if not used properly. Always follow the instructions carefully and consider consulting a professional stylist if you&#39;re unsure. Q: How often should I use heat styling tools on my hair?
