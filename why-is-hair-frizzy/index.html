One of the primary causes of frizzy hair is humidity. When the air is humid, the moisture in the air penetrates the hair shaft, causing it to swell and become frizzy. This is because the hair cuticle, the outermost layer of the hair, is raised, allowing moisture to enter the hair shaft.</p><p>Another cause of frizzy hair is damage to the hair cuticle. This can be caused by heat styling, chemical treatments, or harsh hair care products. When the cuticle is damaged, the hair is more prone to frizzing, as the cuticle is no longer able to protect the hair shaft from moisture.</p><p>Finally, some people are just more prone to frizzy hair due to genetics. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you may be more likely to experience frizz.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Prevent Frizzy Hair</h2><p>Preventing frizzy hair starts with proper hair care.
