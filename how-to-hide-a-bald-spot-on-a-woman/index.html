These products come in a variety of colors and can be applied directly to the scalp to create the illusion of thicker hair.</p><h3>Hair Transplantation</h3><p>Hair transplantation is a more permanent solution for women with bald spots. This procedure involves transplanting hair follicles from one area of the scalp to another.
