It adds height and volume to the crown of the head, and can be styled with a side part or swept back for a more polished look.</p><h3>Layered Lob</h3><p>A layered lob (long bob) is a great option for those who prefer longer hair. It adds movement and texture, and can be styled straight or wavy for a casual or formal look.</p><h3>Textured Crop</h3><p>A textured crop is a modern and edgy style that works well for thin hair.
