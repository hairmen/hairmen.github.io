Although smoothening gives your hair a sleek and shiny look, it can also damage your hair strands and cause hair fall. In this article, we'll discuss how to avoid hair fall after smoothening and provide you with tips on how to care for your hair. <h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to Avoid Hair Fall After Smoothening</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall After Smoothening</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care After Smoothening</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2> Hair smoothening is a popular treatment that makes your hair look straight and shiny. The process involves the use of chemicals that break down the bonds of your hair, followed by the use of a flat iron to straighten your strands. However, the chemicals used in smoothening can weaken your hair, making it prone to breakage and hair fall. <h2 id="how-to">How to Avoid Hair Fall After Smoothening</h2> Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to avoid hair fall after smoothening. These include: <h3>1. Avoid Washing Your Hair for a Few Days</h3> After smoothening, it's best to avoid washing your hair for at least two to three days. Washing your hair too soon can cause the chemicals to strip away, leading to hair damage and hair fall. <h3>2. Use a Mild Shampoo and Conditioner</h3> When you do wash your hair, make sure to use a mild shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates, as they can further damage your hair. <h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3> It's essential to avoid heat styling your hair after smoothening. Heat can further damage your hair, making it more prone to breakage and hair fall. If you must use heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature low. <h3>4. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3> Avoid tying your hair up in tight hairstyles like ponytails or braids. These styles can pull on your hair, leading to hair fall. Instead, opt for loose hairstyles that don't put too much strain on your hair. <h3>5. Get Regular Haircuts</h3> Getting regular haircuts can help prevent hair fall after smoothening. Trimming your hair regularly can help get rid of split ends and prevent further damage to your hair. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2> Here's a step-by-step guide on how to avoid hair fall after smoothening: <ol><li>Avoid washing your hair for at least two to three days after smoothening.</li><li>Use a mild shampoo and conditioner when you do wash your hair.</li><li>Avoid heat styling your hair, and if you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature low.</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles that can pull on your hair.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to prevent split ends and further damage to your hair.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall After Smoothening</h2> Here are some additional tips to prevent hair fall after smoothening: <h3>1. Use a Hair Mask</h3> Using a hair mask once a week can help nourish and strengthen your hair. Look for hair masks that contain ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, or avocado oil. <h3>2. Take Supplements</h3> Taking supplements like biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids can help promote healthy hair growth and prevent hair fall. <h3>3. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3> Eating a balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals can also help promote healthy hair growth. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. <h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>1. How long does it take for hair fall to stop after smoothening?</h3> It can take up to six months for hair fall to stop after smoothening. However, taking care of your hair and following the tips outlined in this article can help prevent further hair fall. <h3>2. Can I color my hair after smoothening?</h3> It's best to wait at least two weeks before coloring your hair after smoothening. Coloring your hair too soon can cause further damage and hair fall. <h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care After Smoothening</h2> Taking care of your hair after smoothening is crucial to preventing hair fall. Here are some tips to help you care for your hair: <h3>1. Use a Sulfate-Free Shampoo</h3> Using a sulfate-free shampoo can help prevent further damage to your hair. Sulfates can strip away the natural oils from your hair, leading to dryness and breakage. <h3>2. Deep Condition Your Hair Regularly</h3> Deep conditioning your hair once a week can help nourish and strengthen your hair. Look for deep conditioning treatments that contain ingredients like keratin, amino acids, or plant extracts. <h3>3. Protect Your Hair From the Sun</h3> UV rays from the sun can damage your hair, causing it to become brittle and prone to breakage. Make sure to protect your hair by wearing a hat or using a UV protectant spray. <h3>4. Be Gentle When Brushing Your Hair</h3> Brushing your hair too harshly can cause further damage and hair fall. Use a wide-tooth comb or a brush with soft bristles to gently detangle your hair. <h3>5. Avoid Chemical Treatments</h3> Avoid using chemical treatments like perms or relaxers after smoothening. These treatments can further damage your hair, leading to breakage and hair fall. In conclusion, hair fall after smoothening is a common problem, but it can be prevented by taking care of your hair and following the tips outlined in this article. Remember to be gentle with your hair, avoid harsh chemicals, and nourish your hair with regular conditioning treatments. With the right care, your hair can look sleek and shiny without experiencing hair fall. </article>
