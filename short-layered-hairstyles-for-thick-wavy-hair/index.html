For thick wavy hair, a layered bob or pixie cut can work well. Both of these styles offer enough length to show off your waves while still being short enough to be low-maintenance. When choosing a layered hairstyle, it’s important to consider the shape of your face. If you have a round face, a layered bob with longer layers in the front can help elongate your face. If you have a square face, a pixie cut with layers around the crown can soften your features. <h3>Choose the Right Styling Products</h3> To get the most out of your short layered hairstyle for thick wavy hair, you’ll need to use the right styling products. Look for products that will enhance your natural texture and provide hold without weighing your hair down.
