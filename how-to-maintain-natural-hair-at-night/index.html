Protect</h3> Protect your hair at night by wearing a silk or satin scarf or bonnet. These materials are gentle on your hair and help to prevent breakage and frizz. If you don't like wearing a scarf or bonnet, you can also use a silk or satin pillowcase. <h3>3. Detangle</h3> Before going to bed, make sure to detangle your hair. Use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently remove any tangles or knots. This will help to prevent breakage and make it easier to style your hair in the morning. <h3>4. Style</h3> If you have long hair, consider putting it up in a loose bun or braid to prevent tangling and breakage. You can also try a protective style, such as twists or braids, to help keep your hair healthy and protected. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2> Here is a step-by-step guide on how to maintain natural hair at night: 1.
