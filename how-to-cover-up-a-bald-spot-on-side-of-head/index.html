This is a non-surgical procedure that can be completed in a few hours, but may require touch-up sessions. </p><p>Both hair transplants and scalp micropigmentation can provide a long-lasting solution for hair loss, but they may not be suitable for everyone. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Here are step-by-step instructions for using hair fibers or spray to cover up a bald spot on the side of your head:</p><ol><li>Clean your hair and scalp with shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Dry your hair with a towel</li><li>Choose a hair fiber or spray that matches your natural hair color</li><li>Shake the fibers or spray onto the bald spot, holding the container 4-6 inches away from your head</li><li>Use a comb or brush to distribute the fibers or spray evenly</li><li>Style your hair as desired</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your hair and preventing further balding:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals</li><li>Avoid harsh chemical treatments and heat styling</li><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Massage your scalp regularly to stimulate blood flow</li><li>Consider using hair growth products such as minoxidil or finasteride</li><li>Wear a hat or sunscreen to protect your scalp from the sun</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can hair fibers or spray damage my hair?</h3><p>A: Hair fibers or spray are designed to be safe and non-damaging to your hair.
