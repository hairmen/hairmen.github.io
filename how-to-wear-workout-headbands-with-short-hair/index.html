Look for a headband that is made from moisture-wicking fabric, such as nylon or polyester, to keep sweat away from your face. You should also choose a headband that is wide enough to cover your ears and stay in place during your workout.</p><p>Once you have your headband, it's time to put it on. Here are some ways to wear workout headbands with short hair:</p><h3>Option 1: Over Your Forehead</h3><p>This is the most common way to wear a workout headband. Simply place the headband over your forehead and pull it back towards the nape of your neck. This will keep your hair out of your face and absorb sweat.</p><h3>Option 2: Over Your Ears</h3><p>If you have short hair, you can also wear your headband over your ears. This will not only keep your hair out of your face, but also keep your ears warm during cold weather workouts.</p><h3>Option 3: Half-Up</h3><p>If you want to show off your short hair, you can wear your headband in a half-up style. Simply pull the top half of your hair back and secure it with the headband. This will keep your hair out of your face while still allowing you to show off your hairstyle.</p><h3>Option 4: Twist and Tuck</h3><p>If you have shorter hair, you can twist and tuck your hair under the headband.
